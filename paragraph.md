Hello everyone, 
I already told you a little about my self, but nobody wants to hear generic facts all day. That is just plain boring, so let me get a little more specific. 

To being with, I really love computers. There are just so interesting to me. What they make and everythning you can create on them. To be honest, not only 
computers though, I feel the same about all technology. To add on, I really like to play games, but not the ones where you do the same thing over and over
again. I used to play [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) like everyday.
However, I find myself playing less and less games and watching shows/ movies instead. [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix) is literally my bestfriend.
